# Inventory Management System

The **Inventory Management System** is a web-based application developed using **Servlets**, **JSP**, **JDBC (Advanced Java)**, and **MySQL**. It is designed to simulate a simplified Flipkart-like platform for product browsing, order management, and administrative reporting.
